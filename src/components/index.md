# Welcome to my website!

I'm Josef Zoller, a software developer and computer science student from Switzerland.

On this website, you will find information about me and my projects,
as well as my blog posts about random stuff that I'm working on.\
I hope you enjoy your stay!

I don't have pictures of me on this website but here is a picture of my cat:
